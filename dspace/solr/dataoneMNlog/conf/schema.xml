<!--  
 This is the Solr schema file. This file should be named "schema.xml" and
 should be in the conf directory under the solr home
 (i.e. ./solr/conf/schema.xml by default) 
 or located where the classloader for the Solr webapp can find it.

 This example schema is the recommended starting point for users.
 It should be kept correct and concise, usable out-of-the-box.

 For more information, on how to customize this file, please see
 http://wiki.apache.org/solr/SchemaXml

 PERFORMANCE NOTE: this schema includes many optional features and should not
 be used for benchmarking.  To improve performance one could
  - set stored="false" for all fields possible (esp large fields) when you
    only need to search on the field but don't need to return the original
    value.
  - set indexed="false" if you don't need to search on the field, but only
    return the field as a result of searching on other indexed fields.
  - remove all unneeded copyField statements
  - for best index size and searching performance, set "index" to false
    for all general text fields, use copyField to copy them to the
    catchall "text" field, and use that for searching.
  - For maximum indexing performance, use the StreamingUpdateSolrServer
    java client.
  - Remember to run the JVM in server mode, and use a higher logging level
    that avoids logging every request

<schema name="example" version="1.5">
  <!-- attribute "name" is the name of this schema and is only used for display purposes.
       Applications should change this to reflect the nature of the search collection.
       version="x.y" is Solr's version number for the schema syntax and semantics.  It should
       not normally be changed by applications.
       1.0: multiValued attribute did not exist, all fields are multiValued by nature
       1.1: multiValued attribute introduced, false by default 
       1.2: omitTermFreqAndPositions attribute introduced, true by default except for text fields.
       1.3: removed optional field compress feature
       1.4: default auto-phrase (QueryParser feature) to off
       1.5: omitNorms defaults to true for primitive field types (int, float, boolean, string...)

       - If sortMissingLast="true", then a sort on this field will cause documents
         without the field to come after documents with the field,
         regardless of the requested sort order (asc or desc).
       - If sortMissingFirst="true", then a sort on this field will cause documents
         without the field to come before documents with the field,
         regardless of the requested sort order.
       - If sortMissingLast="false" and sortMissingFirst="false" (the default),
         then default lucene sorting will be used which places docs without the
         field first in an ascending sort and last in a descending sort.

         the ordering of the docs will be consistent.

     stored: true if this field should be retrievable
     multiValued: true if this field may contain multiple values per document
     omitNorms: (expert) set to true to omit the norms associated with
       this field (this disables length normalization and index-time
       boosting for the field, and saves some memory).  Only full-text
       fields or fields that need an index-time boost need norms.
       Norms are omitted for primitive (non-analyzed) types by default.
     termVectors: [false] set to true to store the term vector for a
       given field.
       When using MoreLikeThis, fields used for similarity should be
       stored for best performance.
     termPositions: Store position information with the term vector.  
       This will increase storage costs.
     termOffsets: Store offset information with the term vector. This 
       will increase storage costs.

       when adding a document.
