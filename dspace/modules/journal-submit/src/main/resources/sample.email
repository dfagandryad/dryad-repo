Abstract: Allozyme analyses have suggested that Neotropical orchid bee
(Euglossini) pollinators are vulnerable because of putative high
frequencies of diploid males, a result of loss of sex allele diversity
in small hymenopteran populations with single locus complementary sex
determination. Our analysis of 1010 males from 27 species of
euglossine bees sampled across the Neotropics at 2-11 polymorphic
microsatellite loci revealed only 5 diploid males at an overall
frequency of 0.005 (95% CIs 0.002-0.010); errors through genetic
non-detection of diploid males were likely small. In contrast to
allozyme-based studies, we detected very weak or insignificant
population genetic structure, even for a pair of populations >500 km
apart, possibly accounting for low diploid male frequencies. Technical
flaws in previous allozyme-based analyses have probably led to
considerable overestimation of diploid male production in orchid bees.
Other factors may have a more immediate impact on population
persistence than the genetic load imposed by diploid males on these
important Neotropical pollinators.
