			<h1>Searching</h1>
			<h2>Boolean Searches</h2>
			<p>Dryad content can be searched from any of the search boxes on the site. The site supports
				term searching and searching through boolean constructs. The default operator for the Dryad
				search is <span style="font-style: italic;">OR</span>. So, for instance, the search <span
					style="font-style: italic;">beagle finches</span> returns results for <span
					style="font-style: italic;">beagle OR finches</span>, while the search <span
					style="font-style: italic;">beagle AND finches</span> returns a smaller result set because only items with both terms are retrieved.</p>

			<h2>Phrase Searching</h2>
			<p>In addition to searching by individual terms or groups of terms, Dryad also supports phrase
				searching. Phrase searching is the searching of words that appear together in a specific
				phrase. A phrase search is indicated in the search box by the use of quotation marks.</p>
			<p>For instance, in the screenshot below, we see a search for the phrase &quot;conservation
				genetics&quot;. If the quotation marks weren't used, a search for the two terms would find  all documents containing either word and would return
				many more results than the more focused phrase search in which only items containing that exact phrase are returned.</p>

			<h2>Narrowing Using Facets</h2>
			<p>Dryad also supports narrowing searches through the use of facets. Facets will display on
				the left side of the screen and can be clicked to narrow the result set</p>
