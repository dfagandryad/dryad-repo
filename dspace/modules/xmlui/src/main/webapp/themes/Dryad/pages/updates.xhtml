			<h1>New Dryad Content</h1>
			<p>Dryad offers the ability to track newly submitted data packages via email, Web (RSS/Atom)
				feeds, and a Twitter stream. Setting up any of these methods to stay informed about new
				Dryad data packages is relatively simple and can be completed in just a few steps.</p>
			<h2>Subscribing to the Web Feed</h2>
			<p>Another way to be alerted on the publication of new data packages is to subscribe to the
				Dryad Web (RSS/Atom) feed. Subscribing to a Web feed requires that you use a feed reader.
				There are many free options, like <a href="http://www.feedlooks.com/">FeedLooks</a> or <a
					href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>.</p>
			<p>Once you have a feed reader that you like, you can subscribe to the new data packages
				feed by visiting the Dryad home page and clicking on the orange icon to the right of the
				text: <span style="font-weight: bold;">Recently Published Data</span>.</p>
			<div style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="/themes/Dryad/images/screenshots/dryad-home.png" style="padding: 30px;"
					alt="Screenshot of Dryad home page" />
			</div>
			<p>Depending on your browser, clicking on the orange icon will give you a display like the
				below.</p>
			<div style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="/themes/Dryad/images/screenshots/save-feed.png" style="padding: 30px;"
					alt="Saving the Web feed" />
			</div>
			<p>From this screen, you can select the feed reader in which you'd like to read the Dryad Web
				feed. Once you've subscribed to the Web feed, you will continue to get updates in your feed
				reader.</p>
			<h2>Configuring Email Alerts</h2>
			<p>To configure Dryad to send an email each time a new data package is uploaded, you will
				first need to register as a Dryad user. Note that you do not need to register as a Dryad
				user if you want to track recent additions through the Web feed or Twitter stream. To
				register as a Dryad user, go to the Dryad home page and look for the <span
					style="font-weight: bold;">My Account</span> section on the left.</p>
			<div style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="/themes/Dryad/images/screenshots/dryad-home.png" style="padding: 30px;"
					alt="Screenshot of Dryad home page" />
			</div>
			<p>Once you have registered and logged in, click on <span style="font-weight: bold;"
					>Profile</span> link in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">My Account</span> section.
				The image below shows where to find it as well as what the main screen will look like once
				the profile link has been clicked.</p>
			<div style="text-align: center;">
				<img src="/themes/Dryad/images/screenshots/subscribe-email.png" style="padding: 30px;"
					alt="Screenshot of Dryad profile page" />
			</div>
			<p>In the profile under <span style="font-weight: bold;">Email Subscriptions</span>, there is
				a drop down listing all the collections within Dryad. To get notified of new data packages,
				select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Packages</span> collection. It may seem
				like you should select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data Files</span> collection
				too, but in Dryad data files are subsumed under the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Data
					Packages</span> collection.</p>
			<h2>Following the Twitter Stream</h2>
			<p>If you have a Twitter account, you may want to follow one of the two Dryad Twitter
				accounts.</p>
			<p><a href="http://twitter.com/datadryad">DataDryad</a>: A feed for news of interest to those
				interested in Dryad</p>
			<p><a href="http://twitter.com/dryaddata">DataDryadNew</a>: A feed for the notification of
				recent data publications</p>
			<p>If you are interested in being notified about new data packages via Twitter, subscribe to
				the second account.</p>
