    <h1>About Dryad</h1>
    
    <p>Dryad is both an international repository of data underlying peer-reviewed articles in the basic and applied biosciences, 
      and a membership organization, governed by journals, publishers, scientific societies, and other stakeholders.  Dryad welcomes 
      data submissions related to published, or accepted, scholarly publications.</p>

    <p>Dryad's objectives are to serve as a repository for tables, spreadsheets, and 
	    all other kinds of data that do not have another discipline-specific repository, 
	    and to enable scientists to:</p>
    <ul class="text-list">
      <li>validate published findings,</li>
      <li>explore new analysis methodologies,</li>
      <li>repurpose data for research questions unanticipated by the original authors,</li>
      <li>perform synthetic studies, and</li>
      <li>utilize data for educational purposes.</li>
    </ul>
      
    <p>Dryad is distinguished by the close association of data deposition with the process and business of scholarly publishing, and by using article publication 
      as a model for how researchers can benefit from data sharing infrastructure. Dryad has the potential to transform the way research data are communicated and 
      preserved. The credibility and effectiveness of the research enterprise is due in large part to the social contract behind scholarly publishing. Researchers 
      disclose their work to their peers in return for professional credit. In so doing, they also expose their findings to be confirmed or refuted, and enable other 
      researchers to build upon their results. Dryad seeks to extend this social contract to research data by providing a model for how a disciplinary repository can 
      motivate researchers to disclose the data that is of the greatest value for scientific reuse, that associated with publications, and realize the manifold benefits 
      of free access to scientific data in perpetuity.</p>
    
    <p>Dryad welcomes the involvement of journals, editors, publishers,
      authors and others who support data archiving. Authors may submit data
      files associated with their publications. Editors and journals can
      facilitate their authors’ data archiving by setting up automatic
      notifications to Dryad of accepted manuscripts, streamlining the
      authors’ process for depositing data. To learn more about <a
