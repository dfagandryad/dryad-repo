        <p>Dryad is a <strong>nonprofit</strong> organization that provides <strong>long-term access</strong> 
        to its contents at <strong>no cost</strong> to researchers, educators or students, irrespective of 
        nationality or institutional affiliation. Dryad is able to provide free access to data due to
        financial support from members and data submitters.</p>
    
        <p>Dryad’s <strong>Data Publishing Charges (<abbr title="Data Publishing Charge">DPC</abbr>s)</strong> 
        are designed to sustain its core functions by recovering the basic costs of curating and preserving 
        data. New innovations are enabled by research and development grants and by support from donors.</p>
           
        <h2>For individuals</h2>
        <p><a href="/pages/journalLookup">Look up your journal</a> and/or see our 
        <a href="/pages/institutionalSponsors">list of institutional sponsors</a> to see if your DPC will be covered by 
        a sponsor. If not sponsored, the base DPC for data from journals with integrated submission is 
        <span class="msg-DPC_pay_on_submission">$80</span>. For 
        data from non-integrated journals, an additional <span class="msg-excessDataStorageFee_per_additional_GB">$10</span>
        will be charged to individual submitters, to cover added curation costs.</p>
        
        <p><strong>Waivers</strong> are granted upon request for submissions originating from researchers based in 
        countries <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups">classified 
        by the World Bank as low-income or lower-middle-income economies</a>.</p>        
        
        <h3 id="excess-data-storage">Excess data storage</h3>        
        <p>For data packages in excess of the 10 GB size limit, <span class="msg-excessDataStorageFee_first_GB">$15</span>
        will be charged for the first GB and <span class="msg-excessDataStorageFee_per_additional_GB">$10</span> for 
        each additional GB or part thereof, payable by the submitter.</p>

        <p>Organizations (including publishers, scientific societies, libraries, funders, and others) are encouraged to <strong>cover the costs of data publishing on behalf of their community of researchers</strong>. For instance, a society or publisher may sponsor the DPCs for all the authors of its journals.</p>
		<p>To do this, Dryad offers a variety of flexible payment plans that provide for volume discounts. (Sustainer and Supporter-level <a href="/pages/membershipOverview#becomeAMember">members</a> receive additional discounts).</p>

      <h2 class="pricing-plan">Plan 1: Voucher Plan</h2>
      <p>Organizations are invited to purchase a block of vouchers for future submissions. 
      The minimum purchase is 25 vouchers. This plan is open to any organization and is a good 
      option for funders or institutions. Vouchers can be used on any submission for any publication.</p>

      <h2 class="pricing-plan">Plan 2: Deferred Payment</h2>
      <p>Under the deferred payment plan, organizations are invoiced for DPCs for the number of packages 
      submitted by your authors in the previous quarter. This plan is open to publishers, publishing societies 
      and independent journals. Participants must enter into a contract of at least one year in duration and 
      may cap the number of submissions for which they are charged.</p>

      <h2 class="pricing-plan">Plan 3: Subscription</h2>
      <p>A journal (or journals) with an active subscription may make an unlimited number of submissions for 
      a fixed cost. This cost is calculated based on the total number of research articles published by the 
      journal(s) in the prior year. The minimum contract duration is two years, which can start at any time.
      <a href="/pages/submissionIntegration">Submission integration</a> is required for subscribing journals.</p>
      
      <p>Please contact <a href="mailto:director@datadryad.org">director@datadryad.org</a> to discuss which 
      payment plan would be most suitable for your organization.</p>
