                <p>Data archived in Dryad are publicly available,
                and any human subjects data must be properly anonymized and prepared under applicable legal and ethical guidelines.
                When de-identifying your data, both direct and indirect identifiers need to be considered.
                <strong>Dryad does not allow any direct identifiers, but a dataset may contain up to 3 indirect identifiers</strong>.
                Direct identifiers include variables such as participantâ€™s name, initials, email, and postal code;
                indirect identifiers are data that if combined might lead to identification (see below).</p>
