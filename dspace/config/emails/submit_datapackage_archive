The UK-based Digital Curation Centre is looking for your help to respond to their 10 minute questionnaire on what matters to you when choosing where to deposit your data. You can find the questionnaire here:
  https://www.survey.ed.ac.uk/depositers
Results will contribute to an assessment framework for Dryad, and the questionnaire includes entry to a drawing for an $80/£50 Amazon gift card. DCC are carrying this out as part of the Dryad UK project, which also involves the British Library and Oxford University's Image Bioinformatics Lab.
